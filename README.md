# WDI Project - The Wikinian

**WDI Project #2** - The Wikinian is a Ruby-based internal wiki app for "Henrietta", 
our pretend client for project #2. Henrietta is a business magnate and wants to create a internally facing wiki for her organization. She wants her employees to be able to write articles in order to inform colleagues about their insights.

The users/members are colleagues employed by Henrietta's company.

## Deliverables

* `README.md` (in the root folder of your project) that includes:
  * The project's name and description
  * Your feature spec with links to pictures of your wireframes
  * A representation of your ERD - a picture of a whiteboard drawing will work
  just fine here
  * APIs or modules used and descriptions of each
  * Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost


## Process

1.Trello board with `Backlog`, `Doing`, and `Done` lists
    - https://trello.com/b/ssjQUtDT
- Entity Relationship Diagram: https://github.com/Githubbubber/githubbubber.github.io/blob/master/thewikinian/public/img/Erd.jpg
- Wireframe using Skeleton framework
- CRUD routes (create, read, update, delete for app data)


## Instructions
1. The Wikinian can be found here: 
    - Cloning to your local directory at git@github.com:Githubbubber/thewikinian.git (instructions can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
        OR
    - Visiting the heroku-hosted site here: https://thewikinian.herokuapp.com/
- Take a look at the articles users contributed. 
- Sign up to become a member of The Wikinian community.
- Participate in article entry edits, or to add your own articles: Add categories, keep track of other contributors' articles/edits, etc.


## Notes
- The viewer won't be able to see the form to post an article unless they are logged in, nor will they be able to edit any current articles.
- Users can delete their own account but cannot delete an article once it's posted. This is to maintain the flow of discussion, as the wiki was originally intended.
